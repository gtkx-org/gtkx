Consolidate Toast controls into `useToast().show()` and `useToast().dismissAll()`, with individual dismissal through the returned toast. Restrict native exports to supported operations, move the generated wrapper-retention helper to the runtime internal entrypoint, isolate testing renderer errors by root, and centralize configuration dependency tracking. Allow TODO/FIXME comments and link upstream workarounds to their removal trackers.
